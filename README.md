# prangler

## Welcome to the prangler wiki!
## Prangler is an **internal-use only** pre-wrangling tool for Chinese medical records, which will facilitate the data merge and subseting.

It provides many functions beyond other spreadsheet's capability, such as double sheets merge (column combine), multiple rows integration (row combine), exact regular-expression filtering, and stepwise counting for remnant results.
